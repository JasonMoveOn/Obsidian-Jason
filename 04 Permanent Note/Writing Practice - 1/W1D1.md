## Original 
Work Day
Hello, I'm Jason, a product manager at an elevator company. I'm 46 years old, and with the age grown up, life is more like a repeat of yesterday.
There are not much of my work day. Get up at 7am, sometime earlier. My wife get up earlier to prepare the breakfast for the family and in recent 3 months one more thing to clean the OK glass of my daughter.
After get up and personal clean up, we have the breakfast. The normal food for breakfast are 粥-*porridge*，包子-*steamed buns*，煎饼-*pancakes*，发糕-*steamed sponge cake*，花卷-*flower rolls* and so on. Generally I will have a glass of milk together. After breakfast, I will watering the plants in balcony. Some time make up the bed or get up my son.
The around 8:00 am send my son to kid garden (sometime grandpa will come to pickup his grandson to kid garden). And I drive to office via the highway -  external circle. Normally it take 40min to 1hour to office. The traffic varies day to day, largely depends on the ratio of the trunk on the road.
When I got to the office, replace the coat first. then have a cup of coffee. Then a day begin...
Each day has it ...

Normally I get off in 7:00-8:00 pm, there always things to do. I learn to get off earlier in 6:00 -7:00 pm since June and especially my farther's foot broken. It takes 25-30 mins if I get off in 7:30-8:00 while it takes 45-50mins if I get off at 6:00pm on the peak of the traffic.

Before my father's foot broken, we have dinner together at their house and then go back home with my son (My daughter normally go back earlier to do her homework). Since my father's foot broken in late of Nov, my wife and I first go to the grandpa's house and take the children to home, then cook the dinner.

After dinner, kill time on phone before and begin to study like English writing, Vocaburary and the listening, other knowledge like git, github, python, chatgpt etc. Some time play chess with kids.

Then go to bed, before sleep, see a play or read a book. And then call it a day.

    - "There are not much of my work day" might be better as "My workday doesn't vary much."
    - In the sentence "My wife get up earlier," it should be "My wife gets up earlier."
    - "After get up and personal clean up" could be more fluid as "After getting up and taking care of personal hygiene."
    - "The normal food for breakfast are" should be "The usual foods for breakfast are."
    - "I will watering the plants" should be "I water the plants."

    - Be consistent with time formats (e.g., 7:00 am vs. 7 am).
    - You mentioned "clean the OK glass of my daughter." It's unclear what "OK glass" refers to. Perhaps clarify this for better understanding.

Hello, I'm Jason, a 46-year-old product manager at an elevator company. As I've grown older, I've noticed life often feels like a repeat of the day before.

My workday starts early. I'm usually up by 7 am, sometimes earlier. My wife, always up before me, prepares breakfast for our family. Recently, she's also taken on the task of cleaning our daughter's glasses. After waking up and taking care of my personal hygiene, we gather for breakfast. Our typical morning spread includes Chinese favorites like porridge, steamed buns, pancakes, steamed sponge cake, flower rolls, and I always enjoy a glass of milk with my meal. Post-breakfast, I tend to our balcony plants and occasionally make the bed or wake up my son.

Around 8 am, I either drop my son off at kindergarten or my father does. My commute to the office, a drive along the external circle highway, takes about 40 minutes to an hour, depending on the number of trucks on the road.

Upon arriving at the office, I start my day by replacing my coat and savoring a cup of coffee.

I typically finish work between 7 and 8 pm, though there's always more to be done. Since my father broke his foot in June, I've been trying to leave earlier, around 6 pm, to assist him, despite the heavier traffic at that hour.

Before his injury, we used to have dinner at my parents' house. Now, my wife and I pick up the children from my father's place, then head home to cook dinner.

After dinner, I spend some time on my phone before studying English writing, vocabulary, and listening. I also delve into other topics like Git, GitHub, Python, and ChatGPT. Sometimes, I wind down by playing chess with my kids.
