# **Day 9:** Describe a place in your town or city that you love visiting.

## Original
I'd like to go to the library in Shanghai city.

There are several libraries in Shanghai, I went to the Pudong library and Minhang library many times. 

It's been a long time I haven't been to library, and even can not remember how it look like. But I still remember the feelings I was in the library: 

It is quite and you can do nothing but read. Read any thing you like, exploring the knowledge and experience the human emotion. Only in library you find the meaning of life and human.

The books which I like most are new tech, 哲学, 心理学, critical thinking, 科幻 and 自传.

Another important reason is there are a lot of magazine in the library. It always a headache to deal with the old magazine, look the magazine in library is more environment friendly from my perspective.

Certainly! Here's a rewritten version of your diary entry, enhancing clarity and emotional depth:

"Shanghai, a city I call home, boasts several libraries, and I've often found solace in the quiet halls of the Pudong and Minhang libraries. It's been quite a while since my last visit, and although the specific details of these spaces have faded in my memory, the feelings they evoked remain vivid.

In the library's hushed atmosphere, I discovered a sanctuary where the only obligation was to read. There, surrounded by towering shelves, I could delve into any subject that piqued my curiosity, from the wonders of new technology to the depths of human psychology. My favorite genres - philosophy (哲学), psychology (心理学), critical thinking, science fiction (科幻), and autobiographies (自传) - offered not just knowledge but also a journey through the vast landscape of human emotion and thought. It was in these quiet moments, amidst the rustle of pages, that I often felt closest to understanding the essence of life and humanity.

Another aspect of the library that always appealed to me was its extensive magazine collection. In a world increasingly conscious of environmental impact, browsing through these magazines at the library seemed a more sustainable choice than accumulating piles of old issues at home.

I eagerly anticipate my next visit to the library. To once again be enveloped in that serene world of books and contemplation is something I deeply miss. It's not just a place; it's a haven where the mind can wander freely, and the soul can find its quietude."
