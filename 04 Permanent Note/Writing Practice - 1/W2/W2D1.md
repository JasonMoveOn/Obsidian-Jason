# **Day 8:** Write about your favorite hobby and what makes it enjoyable.

## Original

There are three hobbies I like most in my life, hiking, reading and listen to the music. 

Hiding holds a special place in my heart.

I grown up in Shui Gang, a small town (actually a steel plant) in the southwest of China in Guizhou province. There are mountains everywhere and my house and school are all on the hill. Mountain are something deep in my blood.

After graduate from university, I went to Beijing. I live in the northwest of Beijing which is quite close to the mountains. 

Every weekend, I will exploring the hiking teams in the website (the name of the website is lvye) to find the routes I prefer and apply to join with my hiking experience. When I get the offer, I can go with the team on that route that weekend.

I went out with may teams and the most frequency team I joined is PP teams. Which I've taken it for Piao liang which mean beautify, while it actually refer to PangPang (fat). The members in the team are fat and they want to keep fit through hiking. All of them are kind and open and I'm very enjoy the time with them. 

Normally we begin our journey in a vellege at one side of the mountain and end up to another side by climb over the mountain. The view is quite different from the bottom to the top. At the bottom, a lot of big trees warm and moist, when climb up, the tree are smaller, when you get to the top of the mountain, there are no more trees and all are covered by grass. Very open and impressive view. In summer it's marvellous when there are lot of unnamed flowers in the top of the mountain, very beautiful and with cool wind come across.

The trip always takes a day, some even over 14 hours hiking. Tired but very enjoyable. After I back to Shanghai and have my child, I do not have chance to go hiking anymore. But I believe some day in future, I will package my bag and forward to the mountain again.

## Comments from ChatGPT
Thank you for sharing your diary entry about your favorite hobbies! It's wonderful to read about your passion for hiking and how it has been a part of your life. Let's go through your entry to enhance its clarity and expression.

1. **Grammar and Structure**:
    
    - The first sentence could be rephrased for smoother flow: "There are three hobbies I enjoy most in my life: hiking, reading, and listening to music."
    - In the second paragraph, "Hiding" seems to be a typo. It should be "Hiking".
    - "I grown up" should be "I grew up".
    - Consider breaking up longer sentences for clarity. For example: "After graduating from university, I moved to Beijing. I live in the northwest of the city, which is quite close to the mountains."
2. **Details and Descriptions**:
    
    - You've beautifully described the landscapes and experiences during your hikes. Enhancing these with more sensory details can make your writing even more vivid. For example: "The view changes dramatically from the bottom to the top of the mountain. At the base, large trees create a warm, moist environment. As I climb higher, the trees shrink in size, giving way to grass-covered peaks and an open, breathtaking panorama."
3. **Consistency and Clarity**:
    
    - Ensure consistency in past and present tense. For instance, "I will exploring" should be "I would explore".
    - Clarify abbreviations or local terms for a broader understanding. For example, explain what "lvye" is briefly.
4. **Emotive Language**:
    
    - Your writing is already very personal and reflective. You could further enhance this by exploring your feelings more deeply. For instance, talk about what hiking means to you beyond physical activity – does it offer you peace, a sense of adventure, connection with nature?
5. **Conclusion**:
    
    - The conclusion is touching, reflecting on how life changes have affected your hobby. You might consider adding a reflective note on what hiking taught you or how it continues to inspire you, even when you're not on the trails.

Remember, diary writing is a deeply personal and expressive form, so it's great to see you pour your experiences and emotions into it. Your love for hiking and the beautiful descriptions of the landscapes you've encountered make for engaging reading. Keep writing and exploring your passion through words!

>"In my life, there are three hobbies that I hold dear: hiking, reading, and listening to music. Among these, hiking holds a special place in my heart.

>I grew up in Shui Gang, a quaint town nestled in the mountains of southwest China, in Guizhou province. My home and school perched on these hills, embedding a deep connection with the mountains in me.

>After graduating from university, I moved to Beijing, settling in the northwest part of the city, conveniently close to the mountains. Every weekend, I eagerly browsed the lvye website, a hub for hiking enthusiasts, to select my preferred routes and apply to join with my experience. When accepted, I’d embark on these adventures with various teams.

>One team I frequently joined was humorously named 'PP', which I initially thought stood for 'Piao liang' (beautiful), but amusingly, it actually stood for 'PangPang' (fat). The team's members, striving to stay fit through hiking, were incredibly kind and open-hearted. I thoroughly enjoyed every moment spent with them.

>Our typical journey began in a small village at the base of a mountain, culminating on the other side after an exhilarating climb. The transformation of scenery during the ascent was remarkable. At the base, towering trees created a warm, moist environment. As we ascended, the foliage diminished, giving way to grass-covered peaks and expansive, awe-inspiring views. In summer, these heights were adorned with a tapestry of unnamed flowers, dancing in the cool, soothing breeze.

>These trips, often lasting a day or sometimes over 14 hours, were exhausting yet immensely fulfilling. Now, back in Shanghai with my child, my hiking adventures are on pause. But I hold a steadfast belief that someday, I will pack my bag and return to the mountains, reconnecting with that part of my soul once again."
