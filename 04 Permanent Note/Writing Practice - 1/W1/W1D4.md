# **Day 4:** Describe your favorite season and what you like to do during that time.

## Origin

I love four seasons, each season are quite different with others and always some specific impressive points. 
- Sprint: Every thing comes back, the ground return to green and vival scense(生机勃勃) every where
- Summer：Hot and you can have water sports, sun shine, flowers everywhere
- Autumn:  Colorful world, harvesting 
- Winter: Silence and quite, all white 

When it goes to may favorite one, I prefer sprint. There is an old saying in Chinese, 一年之际在于春. When the temperature goes up, people can have a comfort life even for poverty. And a chance for every one for a new beginning, at least he can seed for the plants. We are grateful life is not an endless line. It’s a circle just like the earth around the sun. That every one has chance to redo it again.

In the sprint, we can planning the new year, setting our goal, breakdown the mile stone and activities. Thus year by year we turn our dreams in to reality.

>It's wonderful that you're using diary writing to reflect on your thoughts about the seasons. Let's review and refine your entry:

>1. **Season Names:** You've written "Sprint" instead of "Spring." This is a common typo, so just a small correction there.

>2. **Expression Clarity:** Your first sentence can be more clearly expressed. For example: "I love the four seasons; each one is distinct, with its own impressive characteristics." This avoids repetition and enhances clarity.

>3. **Season Descriptions:**
   - **Spring:** You've written "the ground return to green and vival scense." This could be rephrased for clarity and correct spelling: "In spring, everything comes back to life, the ground turns green, and there's a vibrant atmosphere everywhere."
   - **Summer:** This description is clear, but you might consider adding a verb for consistency: "In summer, it's hot, and you can enjoy water sports, sunshine, and flowers everywhere."
   - **Autumn and Winter:** These are succinct and vivid descriptions. 

>4. **Favorite Season - Spring:** 
   - The phrase "一年之际在于春" is beautifully incorporated. You could provide a brief translation or interpretation for non-Chinese speakers, such as "an old Chinese saying that emphasizes the importance of spring in a year."
   - In the sentence "When the temperature goes up, people can have a comfort life even for poverty," consider revising to "As the temperature rises, life becomes more comfortable, bringing hope even to those in poverty."
   - The phrase "at least he can seed for the plants" could be clearer. Perhaps "everyone has the opportunity to start anew, even if it's just by planting seeds."

>5. **Final Paragraph:**
   - "In the sprint" should be "In the spring."
   - Consider breaking down the long sentence for clarity: "In the spring, we can plan for the new year by setting our goals, breaking down milestones, and planning activities. Thus, year by year, we turn our dreams into reality."

**Reflecting on the Four Seasons**

I find a unique beauty in each of the four seasons, each bringing its own distinct charm and moments of awe.

- **Spring:** A season of rebirth and vibrant life. The world awakens, with the ground blanketed in lush greenery and the air filled with the scent of blooming flowers. It's a time when life seems to burst forth with energy and possibility.
- **Summer:** The warmth of summer brings long days filled with sunshine. It's a time for enjoying water sports, basking in the sun's glow, and admiring the kaleidoscope of flowers adorning every corner.
- **Autumn:** A symphony of colors paints the world in autumn. It's a season of harvest, reflecting both the beauty of change and the richness of nature's bounty.
- **Winter:** A serene blanket of white covers the land in winter, bringing a peaceful quietness. It's a time for reflection, offering a stark yet beautiful contrast to the other seasons.

Among these, ***spring holds a special place in my heart***. There's an old Chinese saying, 一年之际在于春, which suggests that the promise of a year lies in spring. As the temperature rises, life becomes more comfortable, offering hope to all, regardless of their circumstances. It's a season of new beginnings, symbolized by the simple act of planting seeds.

In spring, we find ourselves planning for the year ahead, setting goals, and outlining the steps to achieve them. It's a time when our dreams start to take shape, slowly turning into reality as the year progresses.

This cycle of seasons, much like the earth's journey around the sun, is a reminder that life is not a linear path but a circle of opportunities and new beginnings. Each season brings its unique gifts, and in embracing them, we find the rhythm of life itself.
