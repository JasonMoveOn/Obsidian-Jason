## Original - 20231228
Japan, the dream vocation destination for me.

I have went to Japan for traveling with my family twice. First one to 冲绳, go to the seaside and the 水族馆. The second one to 高山, go to the mountain in winder for the snow scenes.

I still remember my dream in colleague. In an English class, the teacher let each student describe his dream to all. I said, I want to go around the world, that is my dreams for years. What surprises me is that I found most of us have the same dream as me. Maybe it’s so called as a dream, because most of us think it will always be a dream too hard to be turned into reality.

It’s true. After graduation. When you have time, you don’t have money. When you have money, you don’t have time. Only a few years you have them both, and we take the chance to France, Germany, Switch, Italy, Thailand, Korea, USA and Japan. No much compare with my dream. Within those countries, Japan is my favorite one.

I have a long list of the impressive things of Japan. 
- Culture: Japanese are very pilot and friendly, every thing is in well order
- Infrastructure: The infrastructure is so good, public transportation, tourism guidance are very clear and 便捷
- Environment: Always tidy and clean, especially in the countryside
- History: The history are well preserved with respected. The best practice on the harmonious between the tradition and modernity.
- Food: The food is fresh especially for the 生鱼片, delicious 

Any the most impressive traveling for me is also in Japan 合掌村 in Jan, 2017. When we get off the bus, I met the heaviest snow in my life. Every thing goes white, it is incredible beautiful. If there is a chance, I’d like to go travel in Japan again, Fuji mountains, ssosi, 温泉… a lot of things to exploring.

Japan, my dream vacation destination, has always held a special place in my heart. I've had the fortune of traveling there with my family twice. Our first journey took us to Okinawa, where we explored the beautiful seaside and visited the fascinating aquarium. The second trip was to the picturesque town of Takayama, where we reveled in the stunning winter snowscapes of the mountains.

I vividly recall a moment from my college days. In an English class, our teacher asked each of us to describe our dreams. I shared my long-held aspiration: to travel the world. To my surprise, I discovered that many of my classmates harbored the same dream. Perhaps it’s termed a 'dream' because for most of us, it seemed too elusive to turn into reality.

Indeed, life after graduation brought its own challenges. When there was time, money was scarce, and when money was available, time was a luxury. However, in those rare moments when both aligned, my family and I seized the opportunity to travel. Our adventures took us to France, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, Thailand, Korea, the USA, and, of course, Japan. While these travels were significant, they still fell short of my dream to journey around the entire globe.

Japan, however, stands out among these countries as my favorite destination. There are countless aspects of Japan that left a lasting impression on me:

- **Culture**: The politeness and friendliness of the Japanese people are truly remarkable, with everything functioning in perfect order.
- **Infrastructure**: The infrastructure is impressive, from the efficient public transportation to the clear and convenient tourist guidance.
- **Environment**: The tidiness and cleanliness, especially in the countryside, are commendable.
- **History**: The way Japan preserves its history with respect is a testament to its ability to harmonize tradition with modernity.
- **Food**: Japanese cuisine, particularly the fresh sashimi, is exceptionally delicious.

The most memorable of my travels in Japan was a visit to Shirakawa-go in January 2017. Stepping off the bus, I encountered the heaviest snowfall of my life. Everything was blanketed in white, creating an incredibly beautiful and surreal landscape. Given another chance, I would love to return to Japan to explore more – the majestic Fuji Mountains, the vibrant sashimi markets, the relaxing onsen baths... There's so much more to discover.
