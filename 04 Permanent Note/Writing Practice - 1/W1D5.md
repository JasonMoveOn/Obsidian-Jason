# **Day 5:** Write about a cherished childhood memory

## Original

There are a lot of memories in my childhood when I grow up in Shui Gang, a steel plant in the south west of China. 

While one I can never forget because I might be the only survive of all the parallel universe. That is I died in all other parallel universe after that.

In Shui Gang, building are build on the hills as other places in Gui Zhou province. and there are alway bridge to the ground in the middle of the building. And if the height is not high, sometime there are no 扶手栏 on the side of the bridge. And my story happen just on one of those.

It might be a Sunday afternoon. After launch, I go out side play with the neighbor's kids. As usual, we play hid and seek around. And there is a bridge around 3 meters without any protection on both sides. We been there for many times, and no one think this will be a critical risk.

When I ran in hid and seek, I walk back on the bridge and fell down. I only remember suddenly there is a punch in my back. I can heard myself 呻吟了一声 and the whole word slow down. Time seems frozen. I don't know how long it takes for the recovering. When all the sense came back again, I straggling back home.

When my parents know the whole things, they immediately take me to the hospital. There are around 40mins walk to the hospital. I remembered my daddy put me on his back and my mother aside keep talking with me and ask me not to sleep. But I was tired and fritened, keep say I can not make it. That scared my parents.

Once arrive the hospital, I was arrange to 吊盐水 immediately. It's a hospital of the steel plant, actually no much instrument for the inspection, all relies on the doctor. Luckly, after the 吊盐水 is completed, I went back to normal (might because have a rest during the treatment). And it seems no any impact on this accident for me, my parents then release.

It's the closet to death incident for me, and I'm so lucky to pass through. And I see how much love my parents on me on the way to the hospital. How grateful I feels the God bless on me and my family...

There are countless memories from my childhood in Shui Gang, a steel plant town in the southwest of China. Among these, one stands out vividly – an incident so significant that I sometimes wonder if I'm the sole survivor of it in all parallel universes.

In Shui Gang, buildings perch on hillsides, a common sight in Gui Zhou province. They often feature bridges connecting to the ground mid-way up the building. Sometimes, especially if the bridge isn't too high, there are no handrails. My story unfolded on one such bridge.

It was likely a Sunday afternoon. After lunch, I went outside to play hide-and-seek with the neighbor's kids. There was this bridge about three meters high, conspicuously lacking any form of protection on either side. We had played around it many times, never perceiving it as a serious hazard.

During one such game, I found myself walking backward on the bridge, and suddenly, I fell. The only thing I remember is a sharp impact against my back, a groan escaping my lips, and then, time seemed to stand still. I have no idea how long I was out. When my senses gradually returned, I struggled to make my way back home, dazed and confused.

Upon learning what had happened, my parents rushed me to the hospital. It was about a 40-minute walk. I recall my father carrying me on his back, my mother walking beside us, continuously talking to me, urging me not to fall asleep. Despite her efforts, I was overwhelmed with exhaustion and fear, repeatedly whispering that I couldn't make it, which only heightened their anxiety.

Upon reaching the hospital, I was immediately put on an IV drip. The hospital, being part of the steel plant, had limited equipment, so much depended on the doctor's expertise. Fortunately, after the treatment, which included much-needed rest, I returned to my normal self. Seeing this, my parents finally let out a sigh of relief.

This experience was the closest I've ever come to facing death, and I emerged from it incredibly fortunate. Reflecting on the journey to the hospital, I realized the depth of my parents' love for me. I am eternally grateful for this blessing on me and my family.
