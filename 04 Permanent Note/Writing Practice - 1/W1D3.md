## Original 
This is quite a challenge topic for me. If time went back to 20 or 30 years ago, there would be a very long list of my best friends. As time pass by, you have your own family, your kids and less friends.

So in todays dairy, I would like to write about my best friend in each period of my life although some of them lose contact for long time and might not meet in the rest of my life.

Kidengardon: In my childhood, we have 4 naiberhood for many years, the parents are colleague in the same plant and they are friends too. The kids of the 4 families are close and always play together. And the parents will take care of the neiber's children when their parents are busy at work and come back late. We celebrate the lunar new years together, and sometime go camping in the mountain together with the whole families. A very unforgetable time for me.

Primary School: Ma wen xuan is my best friends in my primary school, actually we are classmates for over 8 years. We have a lot of comment interesting like dreaming, climb hill, play video game and etc. I still remember we build a glass made house in a secret corner of a small garden, and when we go back 2 days later, the house is still there with a shit of aosome smells. We are very sad in the beginning and then a big laugh when we found what a funny shit of this.
There are some other things crazy for us, we boom the shit in winter. One was responsible to plug the 鞭炮 into the shit and the other one was responsible for the firing. The one firing need to run very quick to avoid the 炸开来的 shit. 

Middle School: My 同桌, we lost contact for many years and I only remember there is a 慧 in her name which means kind and smart in Chinese. I do not remember much but we have a lot mails when I left Shui Gang to Jia Xin City. In my memory, she is very kind and helped me in my homework when I was sick. I have a picture of her, always sunny smiling...

Middle school: Lizhiguo, Guxinyu, Panfeng, Xujun, Wu yiyuan, Huangchongyin, Wandinjun ... a very long list, there are all my classmates. When I move from Shui Gang to Jiaxing, just like a kid from country side to morden city. They welcome me and take me as a part of them, we play together, study together. I remember we have soccer almost everyday after school, we prepare cards for Christmas and New year for each one. And they bough me a birthday cake, the first in my life... I will never forget that day.

High school: Fangliang, Wangfei, Yujin, Zhouchao, Lushihao, Huazhengning... 3 years classmates in high school. We spend each summery and winter holiday together, play soccer in the field, play cards, play video games. Just like the happy days with no worry will last for ever

College: Yanghengfeng, my roommates, a gental guys who is very good at computer. A warm heart people always will to help others. I remember in a very cold winter, it was raining. I asked him to go with me to pick up a high school classmates in the train station, and he agreed! We get up in the 2 o'clock in the morning and wait for the bus in rain, we all get wet when we back to school. That day is really a bad day and I was grate for the friendship even many years after.

After graduate: Fu guangchao, Jinliang, Xiaoruihua, we are the four guys in the same major radio frequency. We play network game almost every night together, is that crazy, yes it is!
