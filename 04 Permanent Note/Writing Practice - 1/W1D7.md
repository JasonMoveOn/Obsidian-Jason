# **Day 7:** Reflect on a movie or book you recently enjoyed

## Original
Reflect on a movie or book I recently enjoyed. This is quite a challenge topic for me. Not because there are no movie or book in recently for me, just because I'm not good at remember things and the expression of a movie or book is really hard for me to go deeply in English.

Any I will try to make it.

I'm reading *Poor Economics*. I've red the book before while most of the content I forget. When there is someone who write a reading notes on this book, I decide to read it again.

I haven't completed the book and what I've taken away are:
- the author takes a lot of A/B test and experiment for the analysis which is more objective and some result are quite different as our common sense
- In India and Africa, there are many poverty people who are suffering from the sickness caused by the shortage of basic material for daily life. Such as anti-moisquite net, shortage of food and water etc. 
- And I'd like the book also shares many comments to make the world better more than just analysis why many activity with good willingness fails finally.
I'd like the sentences in the last of the recommendation of the book:
>“The book also tells a lot about where hope lies: why token subsidies might have more than token effects; how to better market insurance; why less may be more in education; why good jobs matter for growth. Above all, it makes clear why hope is vital and knowledge critical, why we have to keep on trying even when the challenge looks overwhelming. Success isn’t always as far away as it looks.”

And I will add the read notes later on when I finish this book.
