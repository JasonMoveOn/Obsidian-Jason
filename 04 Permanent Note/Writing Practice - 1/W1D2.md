# **Day 2:** Describe your favorite meal and why you like it.

## Original

My favorite meal is Chinese Rice Noodle.

I lived in a steel plant in Guizhou province when I was a child. 

Those days, there are shortage of almost every thing. TV set and Washing machine are the only appliance for most of family (things still much better than 10 or 20 years before, in the middle of 20 century the bubble, radio and even 手电筒 are been regarded as house electrical appliance). And similar situation for food.

In Southwest of China, noodle make of 小麦 is not very popular. People like the rice noodle. Although the root cause should be the 小麦 is not planted as much as in the north China, an other important reason is the rice noodle is more tasty which is more smooth and less stickness than noodle make of 小麦.

What's more, when the rice noodle meets the 羊肉, which we named the Shui Cheng 羊肉粉, it comes out the unforgetable food in my life. 

The following are the most impressive taste of Shui Cheng 羊肉粉 in my mind:
1. The soup is very 鲜美 which made of 炖骨汤
2. The 羊肉 is very fresh with the original taste
3. The peppy power on the top make it a hot food with energy and sunshine

In my memory, I can eat it in the weekend when I when to the market with my parents. In those days, eating outside is not popular because poor. So each time have the Rice noodle just like a holiday for me, and go with my parents to the market is one of the best memory for me. Always sunny day, my parents are younger those years and a happy family although without money.

I haven't eat the Shui Cheng 羊肉粉 for years. Maybe I don't want, because I'm afraid when the day I have chance to eat it again, I can not get things back. The taste, the feeling might be quite different with those in my memory. I'm afraid that will reconstruct my memory, one of the best memory in my mind.

**[Diary Entry Title: Nostalgic Flavors: My Beloved Shui Cheng Lamb Rice Noodle]**

>Growing up in a steel plant in Guizhou province, my childhood was marked by simplicity and scarcity. In those times, a TV set and a washing machine were luxuries, a significant improvement from the mid-20th century when even a flashlight was considered a household appliance. This scarcity extended to food as well.

>In Southwest China, wheat noodles weren't as popular as rice noodles. This preference wasn't just because wheat was less cultivated compared to the north; it was also because rice noodles, smoother and less sticky than wheat noodles, were simply more delicious.

>The ultimate delight, however, came from combining rice noodles with lamb - a dish we fondly call Shui Cheng Lamb Rice Noodle. This dish remains an unforgettable part of my life, for several reasons:

>1. **The Soup**: Its rich and flavorful broth, made from slow-cooked bone soup, was simply divine.
>2. **The Lamb**: The lamb meat was always fresh, preserving its natural taste.
>3. **The Peppery Kick**: A sprinkling of peppery powder on top turned it into a vibrant and energetic dish, bursting with warmth.

>Eating Shui Cheng Lamb Rice Noodle was a weekend treat during market visits with my parents. Back then, dining out was a rarity due to economic constraints, so each rice noodle meal felt like a celebration. Those sunny days, with my youthful parents and our content, though financially limited family, are some of my most cherished memories.

>It's been years since I last tasted Shui Cheng Lamb Rice Noodle. Part of me hesitates to revisit it. I fear that it might not align with the cherished flavors and feelings of my past. I worry that a different experience might alter those precious memories, some of the best in my life.
